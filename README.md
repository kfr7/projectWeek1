### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, learning CSS in detail such as flex boxes was crucial to getting the web site to look as clean as it is. Also, working with javascript and event listeners allowed me to be able to animate
certain things that allowed the web site to seem more dynamic. I felt pretty prepared other than properly getting modals to show up but I ended up learning that on my own.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have added the embedded youtube video if I had more time. Also, I would have liked to clean up some issues such as the search box 
not clearing even after the user clicks the home button. Also, when there are no more movies/pages, I would make the "No more movies" display
in a better fashion.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I noticed that they embedded the youtube videos so that is something that I definitely need to learn and be able to implement.
